Syscalls follow the System V AMD64 ABI calling convention/
A function that returns 0/-1 on success/failure will be refered as "s/f".

NAME        RDI     RSI                RDX                      RCX            DESCRIPTION
DRAW        1       uint8_t xcord      uint8_t ycord            uint8 rgb      Draws a pixel at (x,y) with rgb color (in hex), returns -2/-1 on invalid color/coordinate, 0 if ok
READ        2                                                                  Waits for a keystroke and returns its code.
GETRES      3       ScreenRes * res                                            Load screen resolution into res, returns void.
MEMDUMP     4       void * src         void * dest                             Loads 32 bytes of memory from src to dest, returns s/f.
GETTIME     5       Time * time                                                Loads system time into time, returns void.
CPUINFO     6       CpuInfo * name                                             Loads processor brand name, and description, with a max length of 50 and 70 bytes each.
CPUTEMP     7                                                                  Returns the temperature of the CPU in Celsius.
LASTEXCEPTION 8     LastException *LastException                               Loads information about the last exception that was produced.
GETREGBKP   9       RegBkp *RegBkp                                             Loads the status of the registers from the last time TAB was pressed.
